# Todolist ISAAC and MITCHEL

​📝 TodoList: Our First Full Stack App
​Welcome to TodoList, a collaborative project built by Isaac and his partner. This application is designed to help us master the Java Full Stack ecosystem by building a real-world task management tool.
​🚀 Project Overview
​The TodoList is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. It features a robust Java backend and a dynamic, responsive frontend.
​🛠️ The Tech Stack

Layer Technology Purpose
Frontend HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript User Interface & Interactivity
Backend Java 17+, Spring Boot Business Logic & API Endpoints
Database H2 (In-Memory) / MySQL Persistent Data Storage
Build Tool Maven Dependency Management
Version Control Git & GitHub Collaborative Coding

🏗️ Features
​Create Tasks: Add new items to the list with a description.
​Track Status: Mark tasks as "Pending" or "Completed."
​Real-time Updates: The frontend communicates with the Java API to show changes instantly.
​Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved so they remain even after a page refresh.
